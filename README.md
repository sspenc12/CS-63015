# CS-63015
Repository dedicated to coursework and projects for CS-63015: Data Mining Techniques.

Assignment #1:

This assignment focused on introducing general topics of databases, data warehouses, definitions, and differences between different modeling techniques (i.e. classification vs. regression vs. clustering). Additionally, the difficulties of mining large data sets was also investigated.

Assignment #2:

This assignment focused on the general descriptive statisics, quantile plots, dissimilarities between different types of objects.

Assignment #3:

This assignment focused on data integration issues, different types of normalization, different methods for partitioning data.

Assignment #4:

This assignment focused on the different types of schemas used to represent databases, such as the star, snowflake, and galaxy schemas. Additionally, OLAP operations were discussed on how to roll-up and drill-down through data.

Assignment #5:

This assignment focused on cuboids and how to calculate nonempty aggregate cells based on provided information, as well as looking at spare iceberg cubes and the chunking process.

Assignment #6:

This assignment focused on frequent item sets, confidence, and association rules via the Apriori and FP-Growth methods. It discussed the positive and negative factors related to both methods.

Assignment #7:

This assignment focused on constraint-based pattern mining, compressing large data sets, k most representative patterns, and semantic annotations.

Assignment #8:

This assignment focused on decision trees, the process of pruning trees, and mining them for rules. Additionally, it touched lightly on memory usage required and Bayesian classification.

Assignment #9:

This assignment focused on different types of classification, such as associative and discrimitive pattern-based classification. Additionally, it looked at eager/lazy classification, k-nearest neighbor, genetic algorithms, fuzzy sets, supervised/un-supervised/active/transfer learning methods.

Assignment #10:

This assignment focused on different methods of clustering. These methods included partitioning, hierarchical, density-based, and grid-based methods. The k-means and k-mediod algorithms were discussed for finding cluster centers.

Assignment #11:

This assignment focused on frequent item set mining and different algorithms available for mining, such as MaPle, SimRank, and SCAN.

Assignment #12:

This assignment focused on outliers detection and calculations via semi-supervised methods. Outlier scores and nested loop approaches were also looked at.

Assignment #13:

This assignment focused on different types and reasons for data mining. For example, statistical data mining, audio data mining, and visual data mining.
